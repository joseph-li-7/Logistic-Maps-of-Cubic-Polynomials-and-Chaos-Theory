# Logistic Maps of Cubic Polynomials and Chaos Theory

This assignment explores the dynamics of a class of cubic polynomials on the interval
[0, 1] using Python. The goal is to analyze the specific function: g(x) = -2x^3 + 3(j + k)x^2 - 6jkx + 4, where j and
k are parameters derived from the last two digits of the student ID. The function is normalized to
create a transformation f(x) that maps [0, 1] to itself, allowing us to study its iterative behaviour.
The program visualizes the function, computes the first few iterations of an initial value, and
generates a cobweb diagram to observe patterns in the sequence. The analysis includes
identifying fixed points, detecting periodic cycles, and examining interesting cases of dynamical
behaviours.
